# Weather-Dashboard

Get the current weather and 7 day forecast for any city in the world!  I developed this simple yet powerful app to get familiar with implementing HTTP GET requests and handling the JSON responses using AJAX.  The JASON response is parsed to dynamically generate HTML.

## User Story

**I want to** see the weather outlook for multiple cities

**so that** I can plan a trip accordingly


## Take it for a Spin

In the field labeled 'City', enter the name of any city in the world in the world then click search to display it's current weather and seven day forecast.  The city you searched for will be added to your history.  Click on the city in your search history to get the updated weather and seven day forecast.
