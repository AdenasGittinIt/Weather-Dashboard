# Weather-Dashboard

Get the current weather and 7 day forecast for any city in the world!  I developed this simple yet powerful app to get familiar with implementing HTTP GET requests and handling the JSON responses using AJAX.  The JASON response is parsed to dynamically generate HTML.

## User Story

The city you searched for will be added to your history.  Click on the city in your search history to get the updated weather and seven day forecast.
